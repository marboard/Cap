# Capstone Project : Metro Portland Oregon Housing Prices

Prices for homes keep on increasing. People don't know when the best time to buy is, or even know the current market.
As someone who does not want to rent the rest of their life, I wanted to create a model that can predict future home prices near me to better inform future home buyers.
